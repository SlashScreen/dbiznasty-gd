## This is the manager for the [b]Granular Navigation System[/b].
## This is a singleton-like object that will find a path through the game's worlds. [br]
## [b]Granular navigation System[/b][br]
## This system is essentially a low-resolution navmesh that allows actors outside of the scene to continue walking around the worlds, so they will be where the player expects them to be.[br]
## The granular navigation system is split up into "worlds", corresponding to the "worlds" of the game. These are roughly analagous to "cells" in Bethesda games.
## Each [NavWorld] contains [NavNode]s as children that are laid out to match the physical space of a world.
## When NPCs are offscreen, instead of using a navmesh, they will attempt to go to their destination by following these nodes.
## This is done to improve performance. However, be sure not to have [i]too[/i] many entities using this at once, otherwise performance may suffer. 
## See project setting [code]biznasty/granular_navigation_sim_distance[/code] to adjust how far away the actors have to be before they stop using this system and just stay idle.
