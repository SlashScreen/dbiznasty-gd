# Skelerealms - An open world RPG framework for Godot 4

Skelerealms is a work-in-progress framework for creating open world RPGs, like The Elder Scrolls series.  
It is made to be modular and extensible, and easy to hook into for actual gameplay.  
It is still under construction, and should not yet be used.  

## What does it include?

- Extensible, modular design
- Persistence of objects/NPCs between scenes
- Items
- NPCs
- GOAP AI System
- NPC schedules
- NPC activity outside of scenes
- Quest system
- Save/Load system
- Spells system
- Skills/attributes system
- Editor tools
- Inventory management system
- Audio events (but not backend)
- Stealth mechanics
- Crime mechanics
- Factions

## What does it *not* include?

- Most game logic; it is not batteries-included
- Terrain system (I am working on a plugin for this, though)
- Open world streaming (plugin also)
- Console
- Audio backend
- Player controller
- HUD
- Dialogue system  
However, the system is designed to be able to hook into these. BYOB (Bring your own backend), though.
